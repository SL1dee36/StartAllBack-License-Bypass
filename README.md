##  StartAllBack License Bypass | Crack Support

This Python script attempts to bypass the license requirement for the StartAllBack application by modifying registry entries. 

**Please be aware that:**

* **This script is not officially endorsed or supported by StartAllBack developers.**
* **Using this script may violate the terms of service of StartAllBack.**
* **Modifying system registry entries can have unintended consequences and may lead to instability or data loss.**
* **StartAllBack may detect and disable the bypass, potentially requiring manual intervention to restore functionality.**
* **The script provides no guarantee of successful bypass or long-term functionality.**

**How it works:**

The script attempts to locate a registry key within the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\CLSID` branch.  It identifies keys without subkeys and modifies the last modification date of these keys. This modification, however, might be detected and reversed by StartAllBack.

**Using the script:**

1. **Download the script:** Save the Python code as a `.py` file or [download compiled programm](https://github.com/SL1dee36/StartAllBack-License-Bypass/releases/tag/StartAllBack-License-Bypass-1.0) `.exe`.
2. **Run as administrator:** Right-click the script and select "Run as administrator" for successful registry modifications.
3. **Execute the script:** Run the script. It will search for and modify the relevant registry keys.
4. **Restart Explorer:** After successful modification, restart Windows Explorer (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Esc, navigating to "File", and selecting "Exit").

**Alternatives:**

Instead of using this script, consider purchasing a license for StartAllBack to support the developers and ensure legitimate use of the software.
