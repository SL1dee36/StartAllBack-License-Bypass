# StartAllBack License Bypass

StartAllBack License Bypass is a small utility designed to bypass the licensing restrictions of StartAllBack.

**How it works:**

StartAllBack uses a unique identifier stored in the Windows Registry to enforce its licensing. This tool modifies that identifier, effectively tricking StartAllBack into thinking it's licensed.

**Disclaimer:**

This tool is for educational purposes only. It is not intended to be used for illegal activities or to circumvent StartAllBack's legitimate licensing. StartAllBack is a fantastic program, and we encourage you to support its development by purchasing a license.

**Warning:**

Modifying the Windows Registry can be dangerous. If you are not comfortable with registry editing, please do not use this tool. It is strongly recommended to create a backup of your registry before using this tool.

**Use at your own risk.**
